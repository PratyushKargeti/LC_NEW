**1. Initialization and Calculating Maximum Reach**:
- To solve this problem, we want to determine the minimum number of taps required to water the entire garden. To do this, we need to efficiently manage the coverage provided by the taps.
- We initialize an array or vector called `maxrange` with a size of `n + 1`. This array will store the rightmost position that can be reached from each point in the garden.
- We iterate through the taps (positions) in the given `ranges` array.
- For each tap:
- We calculate the leftmost and rightmost positions that the tap can cover. We ensure that these positions do not go beyond the boundaries of the garden.
- We update the `maxrange` array for the `start` position with the maximum value between its current value and the `end` position. This helps us track the farthest right position that can be reached from each `start` position.
​
**2. Iterating Through Garden Positions in Depth**:
​
- We initialize three important variables:
- `taps`: This variable will keep track of the number of taps used.
- `currentEnd`: This variable represents the rightmost position currently reached by the active taps.
- `nextEnd`: This variable represents the next potential rightmost position that can be reached by activating a new tap.
​
- We start iterating through the garden positions from 0 to `n`.
​
- For each position:
​
- If the current position is greater than `nextEnd`:
