1. The function starts by getting the size of the input vector `nums` and initializes two additional vectors, `l` and `r`, both of size `n` (where `n` is the size of `nums`). These two vectors are used to store the number of candies to be given to each child in the left and right directions.
​
2. Two loops are used to fill the `l` and `r` vectors. These loops traverse the `nums` vector in two different directions, from left to right and from right to left, respectively. They calculate how many candies should be given to each child based on their ratings compared to their neighbors. Specifically:
- In the first loop (`for` loop from `1` to `n-1`), the code checks if the current child's rating (at index `i`) is greater than the rating of the child on their left (at index `i-1`). If it is, the number of candies for the current child (`l[i]`) is set to one more than the number of candies given to the child on their left (`l[i-1]`).
- In the second loop (`for` loop from `n-2` to `0`), the code checks if the current child's rating (at index `i`) is greater than the rating of the child on their right (at index `i+1`). If it is, the number of candies for the current child (`r[i]`) is set to one more than the number of candies given to the child on their right (`r[i+1]`).
​
3. After calculating the number of candies for each child in both directions, the code calculates the total number of candies needed by iterating through the `nums` vector again and taking the maximum value between `l[i]` and `r[i]` for each child. This is done in the final `for` loop, and the results are accumulated in the `res` variable.
​
4. Finally, the function returns the total number of candies needed, which is stored in the `res` variable.
