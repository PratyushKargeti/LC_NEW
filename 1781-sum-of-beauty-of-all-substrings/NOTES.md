1. The function `beautySum` takes a single string parameter `s`, which is the input string for which we want to calculate the beauty sum.
​
2. It initializes an integer variable `n` to store the length of the input string `s`.
​
3. It also initializes an integer variable `sum` to keep track of the total beauty sum.
​
4. The code then enters a nested loop using two pointers `i` and `j`. The outer loop (controlled by the variable `i`) represents the starting index of the substring, and the inner loop (controlled by the variable `j`) represents the ending index of the substring.
​
5. Inside the inner loop, an `unordered_map<char, int>` named `m` is created. This map is used to store the frequency of characters in the current substring being considered (from index `i` to index `j`).
​
6. For each character encountered in the substring, its frequency is incremented in the map `m`.
​
7. Two variables `maxFreq` and `minFreq` are initialized with the maximum and minimum frequencies of characters in the current substring, respectively. These variables will be used to calculate the beauty sum for the current substring.
​
8. The code then iterates over each key-value pair in the map `m` using a range-based loop (`for(auto i:m)`). For each character's frequency in the map, it updates the values of `maxFreq` and `minFreq` accordingly.
​
9. After finding the maximum and minimum frequencies for the current substring, the code calculates the contribution of this substring to the beauty sum by adding the difference between `maxFreq` and `minFreq` to the `sum` variable.
​
10. The nested loops continue to iterate over all possible substrings of the input string `s`, calculating the beauty sum for each of them.
​
11. Finally, the function returns the total beauty sum calculated over all substrings.
​
In summary, the `beautySum` function calculates the sum of differences between the maximum and minimum frequencies of characters in all possible substrings of the input string. This approach captures the notion of "beauty" in substrings by considering the variability in character frequencies within those substrings.
